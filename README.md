# DeepLearningFirstPassEffect

This is the repo for the paper "A deep learning approach to predict recanalization first pass
effect following mechanical thrombectomy in patients with
acute ischemic stroke"

The model code is under /model/model.py. The corresponding final model is res25.
Others are my comparison models.

You can easily load the model to your own code framework. Data loader is an example for you to modify your data loader.
